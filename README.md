## Trip packing app UI made with React + Zustand
Nothing fancy, just a demo app to get my feet wet with Zustand and more React experience. Simple UI that lets you add items to a packing list, check them off, sort them, and some list-wide operations. Everything saved to LocalStorage through Zustand's `persist()` in the primary store.
